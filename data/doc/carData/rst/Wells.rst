Well Switching in Bangladesh
----------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data on whether or not households in Bangladesh changed the wells that
they were using.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    Wells

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 3020 observations on the following 5 variables.

``switch``
    whether or not the household switched to another well from an unsafe
    well: ``no`` or ``yes``.

``arsenic``
    the level of arsenic contamination in the household's original well,
    in hundreds of micrograms per liter; all are above 0.5, which was
    the level identified as “safe”.

``distance``
    in meters to the closest known safe well.

``education``
    in years of the head of the household.

``association``
    whether or not any members of the household participated in any
    community organizations: ``no`` or ``yes``.

Details
~~~~~~~

The data are for an area of Arahazar upazila, Bangladesh. The
researchers labelled each well with its level of arsenic and an
indication of whether the well was “safe” or “unsafe.” Those using
unsafe wells were encouraged to switch. After several years, it was
determined whether each household using an unsafe well had changed its
well. These data are used by Gelman and Hill (2007) for a
logistic-regression example.
