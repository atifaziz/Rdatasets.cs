-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The SPI (SAPA Personality Inventory) is a set of 135 items primarily
selected from International Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org). This
is an example data set collected using SAPA procedures the
sapa-project.org web site. This data set includes 10 demographic
variables as well. The data set with 4000 observations on 145 variables
may be used for examples in scale construction and validation, as well
as empirical scale construction to predict multiple criteria.

Details
~~~~~~~

Using the data contributed by about 125,000 visitors to the
https://SAPA-project.org website, David Condon has developed a
hierarchical framework for assessing personality at two levels. The
higher level has the familiar five factors that have been studied
extensively in personality research since the 1980s â€“ Conscientiousness,
Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Openness, and Extraversion. The lower level
has 27 factors that are considerably more narrow. These were derived
based on administrations of about 700 public-domain IPIP items to 3
large samples. Condon describes these scales as being
"empirically-derived" because relatively little theory was used to
select the number of factors in the hierarchy and the items in the scale
for each factor (to be clear, he means relatively little personality
theory though he relied on quite a lot of sampling and statistical
theory). You can read all about the procedures used to develop this
framework in his book/manual. If you would like to reproduce these
analyses, you can download the data files from Dataverse (links are also
provided in the manual) and compile this script in R (he used knitR).
Instructions are provided in the Preface to the manual.

This small subset of the data is provided for demonstration purposes.
