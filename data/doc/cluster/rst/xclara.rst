Bivariate Data Set with 3 Clusters
----------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

An artificial data set consisting of 3000 points in 3 quite
well-separated clusters.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data(xclara)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 3000 observations on 2 numeric variables (named ``V1``
and ``V2``) giving the *x* and *y* coordinates of the points,
respectively.

Note
~~~~

Our version of the ``xclara`` is slightly more rounded than the one from
``read.table("xclara.dat")`` and the relative difference measured by
``all.equal`` is ``1.15e-7`` for ``V1`` and ``1.17e-7`` for ``V2`` which
suggests that our version has been the result of a
``options(digits = 7)`` formatting.

Previously (before May 2017), it was claimed the three cluster were each
of size 1000, which is clearly wrong. ``pam(*, 3)`` gives cluster sizes
of 899, 1149, and 952, which apart from seven “outliers” (or
“mislabellings”) correspond to observation indices *1:900*, *901:2050*,
and *2051:3000*, see the example.

    ## Visualization: Assuming groups are defined as {1:1000}, {1001:2000}, {2001:3000}
    plot(xclara, cex = 3/4, col = rep(1:3, each=1000))
    p.ID <- c(78, 1411, 2535) ## PAM's medoid indices  == pam(xclara, 3)$id.med
    text(xclara[p.ID,], labels = 1:3, cex=2, col=1:3)

     px <- pam(xclara, 3) ## takes ~2 seconds
     cxcl <- px$clustering ; iCl <- split(seq_along(cxcl), cxcl)
     boxplot(iCl, range = 0.7, horizontal=TRUE,
             main = "Indices of the 3 clusters of  pam(xclara, 3)")

     ## Look more closely now:
     bxCl <- boxplot(iCl, range = 0.7, plot=FALSE)
     ## We see 3 + 2 + 2 = 7  clear "outlier"s  or "wrong group" observations:
     with(bxCl, rbind(out, group))
     ## out   1038 1451 1610   30  327  562  770
     ## group    1    1    1    2    2    3    3
     ## Apart from these, what are the robust ranges of indices? -- Robust range:
     t(iR <- bxCl$stats[c(1,5),])
     ##    1  900
     ##  901 2050
     ## 2051 3000
     gc <- adjustcolor("gray20",1/2)
     abline(v = iR, col = gc, lty=3)
     axis(3, at = c(0, iR[2,]), padj = 1.2, col=gc, col.axis=gc)
