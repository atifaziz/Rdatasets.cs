Petersen's Simulated Data for Assessing Clustered Standard Errors
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Artificial balanced panel data set from Petersen (2009) for illustrating
and benchmarking clustered standard errors.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data("PetersenCL")

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame containing 5000 observations on 4 variables.

firm
    integer. Firm identifier (500 firms).

year
    integer. Time variable (10 years per firm).

x
    numeric. Independent regressor variable.

y
    numeric. Dependent response variable.

Details
~~~~~~~

This simulated data set was created to illustrate and benchmark
clustered standard errors. The residual and the regressor variable both
contain a firm effect, but no year effect. Thus, standard errors
clustered by firm are different from the OLS standard errors and
similarly double-clustered standard errors (by firm and year) are
different from the standard errors clustered by year.
